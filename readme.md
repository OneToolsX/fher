## Technology Slelection üéÉ

To start, we want only a server for the WeChat mini program. By leveraging the serverless capabilities of cloud functions, we chose Tencent Cloud Function. With a smaller number of users, we can operate at a cost of just 20 Yuan per month. As the user base grows, we can scale up the serverless capabilities. This is our reasoning for selecting this server technology.

For the frontend, we chose Taro, which supports WeChat mini program, Alipay mini program, and the web. An important factor is that we don't want to learn specific technologies for each platform. We want to use the same technology, `Vue` or `React`, to support all platforms. At this time, Taro satisfies our requirements.
